				<h3>What is Dishlist?</h3>
				<p>
					<h5>Personal</h5>
					Dishlist is a tool that allows you to mark dishes from restaurants that you want to try in the future. Search through our menus
					or add your favorite dishes, then rate dishes after you've tried them.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h5>Social</h5>
					Find your friends to see which foods they're interested in trying, and see which dishes have been highly rated by the public.
					This text will probably be changed later.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h5>Help!</h5>
					Our database still needs work! To quickly add restaurants and dishes to the database, <%= link_to "use this link", "http://lawrenceluk.github.io/dishlistscript" %>.
